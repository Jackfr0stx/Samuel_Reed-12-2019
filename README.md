Hello Client,

  My name is Samuel, the manager overseeing the project is currently out of the office and I am getting close to having the site finished, If you could provide me with a few photos and a paragraph or two that tells your customers who and what you are about. I know we are quick approaching the deadline for the project and we wanted to make sure everything was in place and ready when you needed it.
I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you,

Samuel Reed

I know you requested to go ahead and send what was created, during my attempt it dawned on me that I was not as skilled as I thought. I also closed prior to saving my code ( i honestly thought i had retained it) I have remade the code, most of what I have done up to this point is read, interpret and alter HTML,CSS,JSON,Java,Javascript and PHP. None at great length due to how the current systems i use operate. That being said, I can read and understand most of what is put in front me. If I can't I can figure out, and troubleshoot.
